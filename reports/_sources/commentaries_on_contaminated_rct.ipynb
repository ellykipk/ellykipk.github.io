    "There is nothing stopping contamination from taking place even in cluster randomization. The inpatient settings where a provider is likely to attend to multiple patients increases the risk of contamination. \n",
    "\n",
    "Is this the reason for stepped wedge RCT? This kind of RCT is effective in reducing the risk of contamination since it combines both cluster and cross-over design. Here, the patients are randomized to a sequence. The design allows for patients to cross-over to the other treatment arm following the sequence they are randomized into. Of course, this design must include a sufficient washout period to mitigate on carry-over effect. \n",
    "\n",
    "From a logical standpoint, stepped wedge RCT is the solution to contamination problem in the inpatient settings. It has the potential to minimize ignored alerts since providers switch between alert and no-alert arms during the trial. Of course, there is the issue of time. Inpatient patients may not remain hospitalized for a long time. This means that any study of the effectiveness of EHR alert must be based on a clinical endpoint evaluable within a short window of time. But why is stepped wedged RCT not widely used? \n",
